# ♻️ Smart Waste Bin 🚮

> An innovative IoT-based solution to automate waste management and promote a cleaner environment!

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Smart Waste Bin** is a smart, sensor-integrated dustbin that detects waste levels and automates the bin lid using ultrasonic sensors and microcontrollers like Arduino/ESP8266. It can also send alerts when full and reduce manual monitoring in public places.

## 🎯 Features

✅ Automatic lid opening using motion sensor  
✅ Ultrasonic sensor to measure waste level  
✅ Buzzer/LED alerts when the bin is full  
✅ Real-time monitoring with Firebase integration  
✅ Low power consumption  
✅ Eco-friendly and cost-effective solution
